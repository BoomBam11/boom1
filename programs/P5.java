/*	Why Do We Have Leap Years?
	Earth's Orbit:
	
	It takes the Earth a little more than 365 days to go all the way around the Sun. It actually takes about 365 days and 6 hours (or one-quarter of a day).
	Extra Hours:
	
	Those extra 6 hours add up each year. After 4 years, 6 hours + 6 hours + 6 hours + 6 hours = 24 hours. That's one whole extra day!
	The Basic Rule:
	Every 4 years: We add this extra day to the calendar. That's why February has 29 days every 4 years. 
*/


/*
 * Special Rules:
	Skip Some Leap Years:
	
	Every 100 years: We skip adding the extra day. So, years like 1900 were not leap years.
	Add Back a Leap Year:
	
	Every 400 years: We add the extra day back. So, years like 2000 were leap years.
	Easy Way to Remember:
	Normal Leap Year: Happens every 4 years.
	Skip Leap Year: Happens every 100 years.
	Donâ€™t Skip Leap Year: Happens every 400 years.
