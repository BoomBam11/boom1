1.
	//Prime Number is a number who's divisible by 1 and itself only.
	


	
2.
	//perfect number is a positive integer number equals to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.
	//6 = 1+2+3 ->true
	//7 = 1 ->false
	
	/*
	 * For the number 1:
	 * The only proper divisor of 1 is 1 itself, but we exclude the number itself when summing proper divisors.
	 * Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 1 is 0, not 1.
	 * */
	 	 
	 
3.	
	special number is addition of sum of digits and product of digits are equal
	// to the number itself.
	
	
4.
	// Niven Number(Harshad's Number) or not.
	// A Harshad's Number is a number is divisible by sum of its digits;

	/*
	 * example , 21= 2+1 = 3 sum of digits 21%3 == 0 //divisible Its Mean its is a
	 * Niven Number.
	 */
	 
	 
5.

	//A factor of a number is an integer that divides that number exactly without leaving a remainder
	// calculate factor of number => 6--> 1 2 3 6
	

6.	WAP to check if the number is a Strong Number or not.
	A number is called strong number if sum of the factorial of its digit is equal to number itself.
	
	For example: 145
	
	since
	
	1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
	
	So, 145 is a Strong number. Now given a positive number N and you have to find the number is strong number or not .
